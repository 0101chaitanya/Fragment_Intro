- onViewCreated
    - override fun onViewCreated(view View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?): This callback is the one
      in between your fragment being fully created and being visible to the user. It's where you'll
      typically set up your views and add any functionality and interactivity to these views. This
      might be adding a click listener to a button and then calling a function when it's clicked.
